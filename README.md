# **Test_Accuracy**
This package provides analytical functions to find the accuracy of the diagnostic tests which will enable clinician to choose better diagnostic test according to particular patient.

Clinicians need insight into the possibility that an individual has a condition to arrive at therapeutic choices and give personalized treatment. This requires integrating knowledge of preliminary chance with diagnostic tests.Sensitivity and specificity are very crucial indicators for the accuracy of the diagnostic test and to know the validity of the diagnostic test. In addition to these indicators, other indicators like Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value(NPV), Likelihood ratios(LRs), Precision and Recall will assure about the outcome of the diagnostic tests which will guide the clinician to choose the type of diagnostic test needed according to the patient.

It includes code of functions Test_Ability(), lr_plus(), lr_minus(), youden(), precision(), recall() and pie_chart(). Data includes a few diagnostic tests with true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. The description gives basic information about the package and author. It also includes a namespace generated by roxygen2.
